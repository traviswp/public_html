            Hi! My name is Travis Peters and I am a second year Ph.D. student in the 
            <a href="http://cs.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Department</a>
            at <a href="http://dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a>. 

            I completed my undergraduate studies in Washington State where I received my B.S. in 
            <a href="http://www.cs.wwu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> &amp 
            <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/math/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> from 
            <a href="http://www.wwu.edu/" target="_blank">Western Washington University</a>. 
            </p>

            <p>
            My advisor is <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~dfk/" target="_blank">Dr. David Kotz</a>. 
            I am currently a member of the <a href="http://thaw.org/" target="_blank">Trustworthy Health &amp; Wellness (THaW)</a> team where I work on problems related to Trustworthy computing and Secure I/O.

            Concurrently, I am also working on the <a href="http://amulet-project.org/" target="_blank">Amulet</a> project -- a collaborative effort between Dartmouth College and Clemson University to create a secure and low-power wearable device suitable for running mHealth applications. In particular, I've worked on the development of a secure and lightweight OS for wearables as well as tools that assist developers in the process of developing energy and memory efficient applications for constrained devices. My current research interests include security and privacy issues in pervasive computing, particularly in an mHealth context, trustworthy computing, and wearable/mobile systems.
